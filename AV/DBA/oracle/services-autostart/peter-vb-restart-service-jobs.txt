rem create windows service via cli:

sc create minecraft-server DisplayName= "minecraft-server" binpath= "cmd.exe /C C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\rungui1151.lnk" type= own start= auto

rem The .lnk file is a standard windows shortcut to a batch file.
rem All this because:
rem service does not know how to start in a folder,
rem cmd.exe does not know how to start in a folder
